  <p align="center">
Zumba Co was a web project completed for a school assignment. This platform acts as a 
                                            compelling 'proof of concept' for the potential design and functionality of a client 
                                            maintenance web application. It encompasses a multifaceted array of screens, including a 
                                            dynamic home page for company news articles, a comprehensive staff and client maintenance 
                                            interface for effective data management, a statistics page that offers data-driven insights,
                                            and dedicated sections for the upkeep and modification of user account information. 
                                            The primary emphasis throughout the assignment was not solely on delivering a fully 
                                            operational application, but rather on learning to collaborate efficiently within an 
                                            Agile framework with a dedicated team of peers.
